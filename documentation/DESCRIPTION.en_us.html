    Gunda is a legibel font with a casual and friendly appearance.
</p>
<p>
    Gunda is a further development of Epunda. In contrast to strict Epunda Sans, it has softer forms that are reminiscent of handwriting, and not just in italics. The small e is also rounded in the regular style, and the tail of the double-storey g is open. The strokes are slanted and the corners are slightly rounded.

<p>
    So far only the styles Regular and Italic exist.
